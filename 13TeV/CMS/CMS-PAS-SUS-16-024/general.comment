comment: "Note: TChiChipmStauStau and TChiChipmStauL do not have the case on intermediate sneutrino, since they should be heavy and decoupled.
SLHA used for validation contains sneutrino, so might have to introduce a scale factor in the constraints ?
From Wolfgang A. I came to know internally that there might be problems with root files, they might not be reliable. For TChiWZoff, we now require also the Z to be offshell, so with respect to the old format we have a few lines less."
