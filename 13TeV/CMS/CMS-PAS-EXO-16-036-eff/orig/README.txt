# These HSCP efficiency maps are made for the 13TeV CMS analysis EXO-16-036
# using the 8TeV CMS recasting from 1502.02522 where we conservatively corrected
# for the differences between 8 and 13TeV by just taking into account the slight
# reduction in the signal efficiency due to a slightly stronger cut on beta.
#
# The respective number of observed events in each signal region are:
