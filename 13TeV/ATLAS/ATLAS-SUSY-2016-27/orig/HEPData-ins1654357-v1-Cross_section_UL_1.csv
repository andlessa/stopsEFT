#: description: Derived exclusion limits for the gluino-bino GGM model explored by the diphoton analysis. For each point in the gluino-bino parameter space, the SR ($\mathrm{SR}^{\gamma\gamma}_{S-L}$ or $\mathrm{SR}^{\gamma\gamma}_{S-H}$) that provides the best expected sensitivity is used to estimate the exclusion likelihood. The model dependent upper limits on cross-section (fb) are shown by grey numbers for each signal point.
