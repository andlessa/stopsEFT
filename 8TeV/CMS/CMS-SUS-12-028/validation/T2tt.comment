comment: "provided by AL: The problem here is that the exclusion curve is wrong. Looking at the official plot they have no exclusion.
I've added a "zero" exclusion curve, which seems consistent with our results.
Added more points to the grid.'Official exclusion curve in the database was wrong'. Verdict do not use this result"
