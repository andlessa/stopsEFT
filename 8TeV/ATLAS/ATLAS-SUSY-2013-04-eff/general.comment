comment: "The official exclusion curves combines subsets of SRs and then
select the best of these subsets. Hence it is expected that the SModelS excluded
region is somewhat smaller than the official exclusion curve.
The T5WW* and T5ZZ* maps were produced internally and do not have official exclusion
curves (except for T5WW with x=1/2)."
