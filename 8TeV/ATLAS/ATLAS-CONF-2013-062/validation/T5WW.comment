comment: "not OK, SModelS exclusions are consistent with the official exclusions. 
The official exclusion line is not compatible with the upper limits. e.g. 
for mother ~ 1000 GeV, LSP ~ 120 GeV, the theory prediction is ~ 24 fb, the 
official upper limit is ~ 37 fb, this point is hence not excluded. The official 
exclusion for this point lies at ~ 1000, 600 GeV which is inconsistent. Verdict, 
donâ€™t use this result."
