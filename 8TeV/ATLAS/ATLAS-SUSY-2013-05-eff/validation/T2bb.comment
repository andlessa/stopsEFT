comment: "ATLAS only provides the best SR efficiencies, so the EM were generated by SModelS + CheckMATE.
There is some overexclusion around msbottom = 570 GeV. ATLAS official
data selects the best SR as SRA-mCT200 in this region, while SModelS selects SRA-mCT250. As a result
this region is excluded by SModelS, but not by ATLAS. This is probably due to slightly larger efficiencies
in the SRA-mCT250 from recasting. Everything else seems consistent and we keep this result."
