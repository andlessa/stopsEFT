comment: "There is some overexclusion at low chargino masses. ATLAS only provides official efficiencies and acceptances
for one signal region, so we use MA5 efficiencies. The production cross-sections seem consistent with the ones assumed by ATLAS.
Therefore the differences are likely due to recasting and we keep this result."
