comment: "little bit of under exclusion obtained because the official 
upper limits for low mother masses jump by a factor of 60, while for 
high mother masses, the official upper limit grid is too sparse. 
Only one mass plane for this topology is available.

comment: The data grid has a gap on the upper left side of the exclusion 
curve. As a result, the interpolation in this region may give UL values 
higher than the ones used by ATLAS. Consequently there is a small band 
of allowed points in this region. Otherwise, the results seem consistent. 
Also, the ATLAS data file contained entries with UL = 0. As a result, any 
point close to this data entry would be excluded, independent of how 
small its cross-section. I have removed such entries from the orig file."
