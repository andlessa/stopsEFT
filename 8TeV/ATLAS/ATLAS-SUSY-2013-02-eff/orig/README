Comments (by Federico):

- Files .txt are taken directly form hepdata website
- Files .dat are converted into SModelS required format (2/3 columns file); the script 'txt_converter...' should help doing it

Before the TGQ study:
we implemented T1 and T2 topologies form official ATLAS results

After TGQ:
- T1 from ATLAS (unchanged)
- T2, T5 and TGQ from SModleS (MA5 recast, homegrown by Federico)
- we extended the T2 since we wanted to cover the squark-LSP compressed region up to 5 GeV mass difference

*IMPORTANT*

The recast maps have only 10 out of 15 SRs, contrary to the official results that contain 15.

So for the 'new' T2, T2 and TGQ we have 5 less SR wrt the official T1
