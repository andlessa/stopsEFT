Note by Federico:

convert.py should be run twice, once for the T1 without the rest,
and again all the other models withouth T1.

This is because I wrote the implementation of the recast maps in a compact way, which is incompatible with the
information from hepdata of the official results for T1.

So it is easier this way.

Remember the second time to increase the number of toy experiments for the UL computation!
