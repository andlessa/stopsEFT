Used the cutbased implementation for T2tt since efficiencies are available, so for this topology we are comparing the same kind of results
UL cutbased, EM cut based.
Used the BDT analysis for the the T6bbWW UL (for EM, only one mass plane is available,
so we cannot produce the maps for the other mass planes) -> the BDT gives better limits.

Lines digitized by hand (FA) ,
since they cannot be retrive directly from data files provided i.e. not a suitable format for convert.py.
