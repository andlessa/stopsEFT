comment: "The validation curve is a single point, since the UL is a 1D map. The value quoted by CMS is m_stau < 340 GeV is excluded.
Although the value obtained in the validation plot is somewhat smaller, the difference is due to the fact that the official CMS value
includes an optimization of the mass cut (signal regions). When compared to the fast simulation curve from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02522.pdf the
efficiencies/upper limits agree within 8%."
