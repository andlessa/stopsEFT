comment: The plane in Fig.1b has one line with UL values one or two orders 
of magnitude above the other points. As a result, whenever the interpolation 
uses one of these points, the interpolated UL value becomes much higher, 
resulting in regions of allowed points inside the curves. Furthermore, 
the original data has a big gap around the legend box in the original plot. 
As a result, several regions of the parameter space can not be interpolated. 
Due to these issues we do not use this result."

comment: "The TChiSlepSlep is has asymmetric masses, but for symmetric brances.
Currently SModelS does not know how to deal with this result. Therefore there are
several cases where the conditions are violated (triangles in the plot) when they should not be.
For now we can not use this result."
