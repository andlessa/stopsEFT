comment: The data grid has a gap on the upper left side of 
the exclusion curve. As a result, the interpolation in this 
region may give UL values higher than the ones used by ATLAS. 
Consequently there is a small band of allowed points in this region. 
Also, the point (112.5,12.5) with UL = 930*pb increases the UL values 
in the low x region (100 < x < 170), resulting in allowed points 
below the excluded curve. Otherwise, the results seem consistent."
