comment: "T2_2Eqmotherx_Eqlspy: not OK, official results have huge gaps in upper 
limits for mother < 500 GeV. No upper limits are available for mother <~ 400 GeV, 
the available upper limits for this region vary at times by order of magnitude 
giving weak exclusion or no exclusion at all. Verdict, discard this result.
