comment: "T2tt model uses 9 different SRs to rerive limits, labelled SRA(4 SR),SRB(2 SR) and SRC(3), where SRA are orthogonal to
SRB and SRC, but SRB and SRC are overlapping. 
On hepdata we find ACC and EFF for the 9 SR but the observed number of events/bkg/DeltaBkg are given, in the
case of SRB, only for a combination of SRB1+SRB2, hence these SR cannot be implemented.
Read also comments by Ursula regarding the validation."
