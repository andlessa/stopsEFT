comment: "Explanation: The official plot (https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2012-166//figaux_04.png) 
has many holes in the upper limits. No upper limits for 300 GeV < other < 400 GeV and LSP  ~ > 25 GeV. 
This causes bad interpolation, leaving us with under exclusion everywhere. 
Same logic applies for mother < 200 GeV. verdict: Discard T6bbWW due to nonuniform upper limit map."
