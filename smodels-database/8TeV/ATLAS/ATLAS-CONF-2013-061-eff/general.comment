comment: "The official exclusion curves combines the 0-lepton and 1-lepton
channels in regions where both are sensitive to the signal (only happens for T1ttt). For these points
we expect an under-exclusion from SModelS. The UL result only considers the 0-lepton channel,
hence the official exclusion curve is smaller in that case."
