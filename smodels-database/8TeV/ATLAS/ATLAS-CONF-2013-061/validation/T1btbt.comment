comment: "Official limits for LSP ~ 200 GeV, mother 500 GeV are 218 fb, 
while for LSP 300 GeV it is 1479 fb, LSP 100 GeV is 22624 fb. For mother 
of 600 GeV, the limit for 200 GeV LSP 218, while for higher (lower) LSP 
mass is 157 (85) fb. This fluctuation causes region below 
450 GeV < mother < 600 GeV, LSP < 200 GeV, to be unconstrained."
