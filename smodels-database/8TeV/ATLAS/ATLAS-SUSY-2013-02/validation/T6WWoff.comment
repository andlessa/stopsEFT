comment: "The exclusion curve only considers left handed squarks. Therefore the plot has to be validated
with T6WWoff_left. However, even using only left-handed squarks the plane lsp=60 still has large
jumps (at low msquark) from bin to bin. Therefore interpolation is unreliable and we do not use this result."
