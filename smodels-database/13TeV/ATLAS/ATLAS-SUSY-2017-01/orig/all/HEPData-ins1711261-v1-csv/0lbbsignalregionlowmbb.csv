#: description: Data and SM predictions in SRs for the $0lb\bar{b}$ analysis for $m_{b\bar{b}}$ in SRHad-Low. All SRs selections but the one on the quantity shown are applied. All uncertainties are included in the uncertainty band. Two example SUSY models are superimposed for illustrative purposes.
