#: description: Data and SM predictions in SRs for the $0lb\bar{b}$ analysis for $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ in SRHad-High. All SRs selections but the one on the quantity shown are applied. All uncertainties are included in the uncertainty band. Two example SUSY models are superimposed for illustrative purposes.
