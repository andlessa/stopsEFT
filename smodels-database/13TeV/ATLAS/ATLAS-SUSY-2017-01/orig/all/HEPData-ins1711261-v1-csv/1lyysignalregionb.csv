#: description: Distributions of $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ before the final requirement on $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ in SR1Lyy-b. The expected contributions from both the peaking and non-peaking backgrounds are shown as stacked colored histograms. Two example SUSY models are superimposed for illustrative purposes.
