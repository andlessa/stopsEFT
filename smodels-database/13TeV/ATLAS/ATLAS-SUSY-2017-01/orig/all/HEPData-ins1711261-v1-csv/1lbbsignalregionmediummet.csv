#: description: Data and SM predictions in SRs for the $1lb\bar{b}$ analysis for $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ in SR1Lbb-Medium. All SRs selections but the one on the quantity shown are applied. All uncertainties are included in the uncertainty band. Example SUSY models are superimposed for illustrative purposes.
