#: name: Cutflow 1lyy
#: description: Event selection cutflow is presented for SM background (pre-fit) and three signal scenarios for the $1l\gamma\gamma$ channel SRs. The masses of next-lightest-neutralinos and LSPs are reported. The uncertainties only include statistical uncertainties. The MC statistics for the signal samples is 10K events in all cases. Samples are produced with generator filters which selects $h \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and $W \rightarrow l \nu$ decays. The data-driven-estimated non-peaking background is not evaluated at each stage of the selection, hence only the peaking background cutflow is presented.
