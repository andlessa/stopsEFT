#: name: Cutflow SS-j1
#: description: Event selection cutflow is presented for one signal scenario for SRSS-j1. The model with next-to-lightest neutralino mass of 175 GeV and massless  $\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})$ with 100% BR is considered. The MC statistics for the signal samples is 75K events. Samples are produced with a generator filter which selects events with at least two leptons with $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 7$ GeV. ``2SS leptons" indicates the selection of two same-sign electrons or muons as described in the text (Section 6.4).
