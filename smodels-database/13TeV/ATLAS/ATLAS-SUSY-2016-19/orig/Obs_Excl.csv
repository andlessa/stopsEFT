#: description: <b>Exclusion contour (obs)</b> Expected (solid blue line) and observed (solid red line) exclusion-limit contours at 95% confidence level in the plane of top-squark and tau-slepton mass for the simplified model, obtained from the statistical combination of the lep-had and had-had channels, using full experimental and theory systematic uncertainties except the theoretical uncertainty in the signal cross section.  The yellow band shows one-standard-deviation variations around the expected limit contour. The dotted red lines indicate how the observed limit moves when varying the signal cross section up or down by the corresponding uncertainty in the theoretical value.  For comparison, the plot also shows the observed exclusion contour from the ATLAS Run-1 analysis as the area shaded in gray and the limit on the mass of the tau slepton (for a massless LSP) from the LEP experiments as a green band.
