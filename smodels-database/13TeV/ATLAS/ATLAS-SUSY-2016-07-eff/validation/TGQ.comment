comment: "Expecting a massive under-exclusion as we are only testing for TGQ, while the limits are given for T1 + T2 + TGQ + .... Why in the official limits the point mG,mQ,mN=(5500,2000,995) is excluded while (3000,1000,995) isnt, I guess is because the contribtions from T2 vanish there. But we dont have T2. "
