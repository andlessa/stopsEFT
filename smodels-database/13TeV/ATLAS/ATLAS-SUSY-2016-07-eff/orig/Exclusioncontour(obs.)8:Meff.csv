#: name: Exclusion contour(obs.) 8  : Meff
#: description: Observed 95% CL exclusion contours from Meff-based searches on the squark mass and the mass gap ratio x in a SUSY scenario where squarks are produced in pairs and decay via an intermediate lightest chargino or second lightest neutralino to the lightest neutralino, $\tilde{q} \rightarrow q \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm} \rightarrow q W^{\pm} \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$, or $\tilde{q} \rightarrow q \tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0} \rightarrow qq Z/h \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$.
