#: name: Exclusion contour(exp.) 9  : Meff
#: description: Expected 95% CL exclusion contours from Meff-based searches on the gluino mass and the mass gap ratio x in a SUSY scenario where gluinos are produced in pairs and decay via an intermediate lightest chargino or second lightest neutralino to the lightest neutralino, $\tilde{g} \rightarrow qq \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm} \rightarrow qq W^{\pm} \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$, or $\tilde{g} \rightarrow qq \tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0} \rightarrow qq Z/h \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$.
