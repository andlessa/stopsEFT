comment: "It looks like the grid values are for the *expected UL* and not
the observed ones. The exclusion region given by SModelS agrees perfectly with
the *expected* exclusion curve. This result has been updated with new root files which contain both expected
and observed ULs. The current data still refers to the old version, so we do not use this result."
